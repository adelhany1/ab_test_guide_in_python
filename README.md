A/B testing is an experiment design and hypothesis testing is a statistical technique for making inferences from data.

The distinction is between how you are collecting data, and how you analyze the results.

In A/B testing you are creating two groups of users. One group will serve as a control the other is the treatment group. We randomly assign the users to one of two groups. This is also called a single blind research design.

Now hypothesis testing is what happens when we want to compare some outcome variable between these two groups from this experiment. We have a null of no difference between the two groups, and we want to see if there is an actual difference.
